While preparing my dissertation I went through a lot of pain and
several visits to the graduate office for format of the dissertation.
I decided to make a style file so that every graduate student of Case
Western Reserve University can use it and have less pain. I will try
my best to explain each thing clearly.

I have written my comments in uppercase in the {\tt thesis-sample.tex}
file.

\section{From Title Page to the First Chapter}
You have to modify the title, abstract, dedication, and acknowledgment
pages of this document by putting your information in. The committee
page is provided by the graduate office; if want to make your own,
fill in appropriate information in the {\tt thesis-sample.tex} file;
remover or insert \% sign before the {\tt
$\backslash$makecommitteepage} command, otherwise.

\section{First Chapter}

If the {\bf INTRODUCTION} is the first chapter of the document after
the tables of contents\index{TOC}, figures, and tables, then you need
not change the top 4 lines in this chapter, which are as follows:\\

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\pagestyle{headings}   % DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE
\pagenumbering{arabic} % DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE
\label{introduction}
\end{verbatim}

Otherwise, you can change only the name of the chapter and the label:

Take care not to modify any other part of these lines. The reason is
that, if you have more than one page of the list before this chapter,
it will not print the page number on the bottom of the page for the
last page of that table if that table has more than one pages; it is
required by the Graduate Office\index{graduate office} that all page
numbering\index{numbering} before the first chapter of the thesis be
in roman\index{roman} numeral and at the bottom center of the page,
and that the rest of the document pages should be numbered with
arabic\index{arabic} numerals.
