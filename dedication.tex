{\Large \bf Dedication}

\vspace*{0.2in}

 I dedicate this work to my father who was a primary school teacher
with middle school education, who had a wish for one of his eight sons
to go abroad for higher education.

 I also dedicate it to my mother who had no education, but could read
the Holy Quran in Arabic, and who stayed awake with me all night long
to keep me company during my pre-engineering (XIIth grade) examination
preparation. I wish they had lived little longer to see their dreams
come true and to see their son become a doctor. He died Nov. 3, 1983
and she died Sept. 13, 1989.
