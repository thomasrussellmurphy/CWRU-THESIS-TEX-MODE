\chapter{Bibliography}

The preparation of the bibliography\index{bibliography} is not very
difficult. Please refer to \cite[pp:140-147]{lamport86} to make a {\tt
thesis.bib}, and follow the following guidelines:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item prepare {\tt thesis.bib} as described in \cite{lamport86}
  \item make sure that the {\tt thesis.tex} contains a line 
     $\backslash$bibliography\{thesis\} after chapters and appendix, if not
    \subitem add the line {\bf ``$\backslash$bibliography \{thesis\}''}
	after the chapters and appendcies, and before the index
  \item run {\tt thesis.tex} through \LaTeX once
  \item at prompt, type {\bf ``bibtex thesis''} {\tt (NO EXTENSION)}; this 
	will generate the {\tt thesis.bbl}
  \item if you intend to include the Index, refer to Chapter~\ref{make-index}
	 Make-Index
  \item run {\tt thesis.tex} throught \LaTeX twice, or three times to be on
	the safe side
  \item make {\bf thesis.alw} or {\bf thesis.ps} as you need
  \item {\bf Be Happy You Did The Job Right}
\end{enumerate}
